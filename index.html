                    <p>I'm a software test engineer at the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/home">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>, where I contribute to maintaining both automated and manual tests for applications that host telescope data. My role allows me to blend problem-solving with the field of astronomy, and I love being part of a team that supports cutting-edge discoveries about our universe.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy working with tools and technologies such as Robot Framework, FastAPI, Python, GitLab CI/CD pipelines, Selenium, and PostgreSQL- all of which help ensure that our systems are robust, efficient, and reliable.</p>
                                        
                    <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about lifelong learning, progressive metal, getting lost in a good book, working towards my next big running goal, and striving to live an environmentally conscious lifestyle by avoiding animal products and supporting sustainable practices.</p>

                    <p>I created this website as a space to reignite my passion for coding and experiment with new ideas. It's a blend of personal reflection and creative exploration, where I share glimpses of the media I love, articles that inspire me, and the moments that make life meaningful. As a software test engineer and aspiring developer, this platform also serves as a canvas to relearn, grow, and experiment with web development while sharing a bit of myself.</p>
